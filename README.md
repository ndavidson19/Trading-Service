# Quanta's Trading Service
Quanta is an algorithmic stock trading software that is accessible through the web. The software utilizes proprietary ML models to make accurate predictions about where the direction of the market is headed and act on them. There is a combination of deep-learning, statistical, and sentiment-based modeling that goes into the predictions. The entire portfolio is managed using statistical and mathematical financial strategies to ensure the least amount of risk. Users can view and track the software's trades in real-time and will explore the notion of profit sharing in the future.

This is one of the software components that makes up the Quanta Application.
